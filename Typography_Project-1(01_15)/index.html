      <span class="first-letter">A</span> As we enter the lower elevations of the Goat Rock Wilderness, I am reminded that there is a sameness to the forests of the Pacific Northwest that evokes deja vu. In the first few miles up the trail, I realize I could be on any of a dozen similar trails I know from Oregon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon, Tim and Eric and their heavy packs will outpace me. I am a slow walker; deliberate, poking each trekking pole in the ground with each step.    </p>
    <p>
      I walk slow, perhaps, because I enjoy walking. Eleven months ago, I decided to walk five miles a day without missing a day.    </p>
    <p>
      The most difficult days have been travel days, when I find myself pacing up and down the hotel hallway to count up mileage. But on the days between, the regular days, those walks have become the best moments of my day. I count birds, I read the news, I deliberate over work tasks, I talk to the dog walkers, I take calls, and I listen to sets and sets of live music.    </p>
    <p>
      Backpacking days, though, are the one day I don’t need to check my mileage.

      The shade of the forest disappears as we ascend into a subalpine wilderness, where smaller pines thrive only in island-like groves.
    </p>
    <span class="quote">"A beacon of light on the darker roads of travel"</span>
    <p>
      As we catch a view of Mount Adams due south, Eric recounts his dad’s harrowing winter rescue on the top of the mountain. It reminds me how lucky we are to have Eric, who grew up actively under the wings of an experienced mountaineer, in our backpacking trio.
    </p>
    <p>
      We set up camp in a small, flat grove, looking out over sloped mountain meadows. Thick with lupine, indian paintbrush and the white plumes of bear-grass, creating a sort of heaven for an assortment of butterflies — fritillaries, coppers and blues.

    <p>
      The next morning, we depart Snowgrass Flats for 7,800 foot Old Snowy Peak, which lies just above the high point of the entire Pacific Crest Trail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Along the way, we reach an overlook from where we can see all of Washington’s big volcanic mountains, rising from an endless layer of clouds. It’s breathtaking. To the north, past the turquoise of snowmelt pools, we can see the long spine of the Pacific Crest Trail — it looks harrowing, like a scene from an exaggerated Peter Jackson scene.
    </p>
    <span class="quote">“Navigating by night is always easier.”</span>
    <p>
      I refuse the final two hundred feet to the peak, leaning into my trekking poles and watching the rocks below for signs of life. American Pikas —threatened Alpine fluffballs---stand sentinel on rocks below, and Gray-crowned Rosy-finches drink from the snowmelt.

        <span class="author">ABOUT ERIK GAUGER</span> Notes from the Road is my project in experimental travel writing.
        By road, by kayak, by seaplane and most of all on foot, I tackle the themes of city and country in the modern world. Travel writing sometimes gets a bad rap, because of 'The azure sea was undulating and the hotel was fabulous.' But travel writing can be funny, powerful and personal. Every non-fiction writer has that capacity to exaggerate; his experiences happen far away from the reader. But travel writing implies honesty and research. And that's why <em>Notes from the Road</em> is my project in the unvarnished, messy truth of travel, told by a regular guy.
      </p>
      <p>
        I named <em>Notes from the Road</em> as a reference to my love for improvised music, and the way that travel, as well as travel writing, are often best improvised.
