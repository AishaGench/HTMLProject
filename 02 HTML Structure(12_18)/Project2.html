        <p>As of June, everyone has already started counting down little by little to leave the city. May it be my turn now! :) To work; I'm starting off with a beach bag that doesn't contain anything about the beach yet.ðŸ™‚ Let's see when that ticket will be bought, that beach bag, that holiday suitcase will be filled? </p>

        <p>We opened the AlaÃ§atÄ± season early this time, in the first week of April. April, May and September are actually the best times to enjoy AlaÃ§atÄ±. Today's shots come from a day I enjoyed this beautiful getaway with my first strappy dress of the season, straw hat and my spring </p>
