         <h2>You Can Learn</h2>
            
        <p>
    Nobody’s born smart. We all start at 0. 
<br>Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do algebra.
<br>Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. 
<br>Nobody’s good at anything at first.
<br>There was a time when Einstein couldn’t count to 10.
<br>And Shakespeare had to learn his ABCs just like the rest of us.
<br>Thankfully, we are born to learn.
<br>Slowly. Surely. You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.
<br>Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.
<br>Until one day, you walk.
<br>One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.
<br>Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit stronger.
<br>Failing is just another word for growing. And you keep going.
<br>This. is. learning.
<br>It’s not that you don’t get it.
<br>You just don’t get it, yet. 
<br>Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe
are built on basic ideas that anyone, anywhere can understand.
<br>Whoever you are, wherever you are.
